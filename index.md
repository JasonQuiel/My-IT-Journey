title: Welcome to my blog

I just wanted a place to document my path in IT and showcase somethings I have learned.  This I hope will re-ignite my passion for learning and bonus would be to help, inspire, or assist someone else's learning journey.

This page is looking pretty sad, but should improve over time as I need to re-learn the github platform, markdown, and jekyll.
